# Fizz Buzz
# Take input from the user. If the input is divisible by 3 then 
# print "Fizz", if the input it divisible by 5 then print "Buzz". 
# If the input is divisible by 3 and 5 then print "Fizz Buzz".




# Three Number Sum
# Given a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer 
# representing a target sum, find all triplets in the array that 
# sum up to the target sum. Print out a two-dimensional array of 
# all of the triplets. The number in each triplet should be ordered 
# in ascending order, and the triplets themselves should be ordered 
# in ascending order with respect to the numbers they hold.

# Sample array = [12, 3, 1, 2, -6, 5, -8, 6] 
# targetSum = 0



# Solution [[-8, 2, 6], [-8, 3, 5], [-6, 1, 5]]



# If you used 3 for loops, can you come up with a different solution?

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
list1 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 5]
list2 = [4, 5, 6, 7, 5]

# # Dont do this:
# for x in arr:
#     print(x*2)
#     for y in list1:
#         c = x * y
#         print(c)
#         for z in list2:
#             d = x * y * z
